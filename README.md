# Welcome to the workshop: Vibe Coding & AI Driven Development

You're now in a cloud-based development environment where you can create applications using **Kiro** - an agentic AI tool that enables development from prototype to production, understanding natural language and writing code for you.

## Getting Started
All the info you need is in the workshop guide. Use the guidelines to create a working application by simply describing what you want in plain English. No coding experience required!

## Step 1: Login to Kiro CLI (Terminal)

1. **Open a terminal** by clicking **Terminal** in the top menu, then **New Terminal**
2. **Type this command** and press Enter:
   ```
   kiro-cli login --use-device-flow
   ```
3. **Select "Use with Builder ID"** when prompted
4. **Follow the device flow authentication process**:
   - Copy the device code shown in the terminal
   - Open the provided URL in your browser (on your local machine)
   - Enter the device code and complete authentication
5. **Return to the terminal** - you should see a success message

## Step 2: Test Kiro CLI

1. **In the terminal, type**:
   ```
   kiro-cli
   ```
2. **When the Kiro prompt appears, type your question**:
   ```
   What is vibe coding, and why is it interesting for me?
   ```
3. **Important**: If Kiro asks for web search permission, **type `t`** to trust and allow access to current information
4. **Press Enter** and see Kiro's response

## Step 3: Amazon Q Developer (VS Code Extension) - Optional

You can use this workshop with just Kiro CLI from the terminal. However, if you'd like to also use the Amazon Q Developer extension in VS Code:

1. **Find the Q icon** in the left sidebar (it looks like a "Q")
2. **Click the Q icon** to open the Amazon Q panel
3. **Follow the instructions in your browser** to authenticate with Builder ID
4. **Return to VS Code** - you should now see "Amazon Q" is connected

**Alternative**: If you prefer to focus only on Kiro CLI, simply click the **File Explorer** icon in the left sidebar to hide the Amazon Q panel and work directly with files and the terminal.

## Step 4: Open Your Workspace

If you don't see files in the left sidebar:
1. **Click File** in the top menu
2. **Click "Open Folder"**
3. **Navigate to** `/home/ec2-user/dev-server`
4. **Click OK**

## Step 5: Create Your Application

Now you're ready to create! Follow the instructions in the workshop guide. Or try these example prompts with Kiro:

**Simple Applications:**
- "Create a to-do list application"
- "Build a calculator with a nice interface"
- "Create a digital clock with current time"
- "Make a color picker tool"

**Games:**
- "Create an application where a user can play connect four against a computer component"
- "Create a tic-tac-toe game"
- "Build a memory matching card game"
- "Make a simple quiz application"

**Business Applications:**
- "Create an expense tracker"
- "Build a contact management system"
- "Make an inventory tracking application"
- "Create a meeting scheduler"

**Utility Applications:**
- "Build a password generator"
- "Create a unit converter"
- "Make a QR code generator"
- "Build a text formatter tool"

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Be specific** in your requests: Instead of "make a game", say "create a tic-tac-toe game with a 3x3 grid"
- **Ask for progress updates**: "Explain which requirements you have fully implemented and which only partially"
- **Request modifications**: "Add a score counter to this game"
- **Ask for help**: "How do I run this application?"
- **When Kiro asks for permissions**: Select **`t` (trust)** to allow Kiro to perform actions like creating files

### 🚀 Creating a mutual understanding
Kiro will create requirements and design specification documents for you to review. Feel free to read it, and provide feedback. Or just accept the proposal and give green light to proceed.


### ⚠️ Important: Steering Reminder

**Why this step is needed:** We created some pre-configured guidelines for this workshop environment for Kiro (like deploying to the `public` folder and using specific technologies that make it easier for you to preview what you have built), but due to a known technical issue, it may not always automatically follow these guidelines. This extra reminder ensures Kiro incorporates the workshop-specific requirements into your project design and implementation.

After Kiro creates your requirements and design document, **always give this reminder before proceeding with implementation:**

**"Remember to apply steering rules. Add the deployment guidelines in workshop.md steering to the application design."**

## 🚀 Running Your Application

When Kiro creates your application, it will handle the file creation and setup automatically. To run your application:

1. **Ask Kiro**: "How do I run this application?"
2. **Follow Kiro's instructions** - it will guide you through the process
3. **If your application doesn't appear** in the NPM server, ask Kiro: "Please start my application"

Kiro will handle all the technical details for you!

## � Need Help?

- **Ask Kiro anything**: "I'm getting an error, how do I fix it?"
- **Use the Kiro CLI**: Type `kiro-cli` in the terminal, then enter your question at the prompt
- **Be descriptive**: The more details you provide, the better Kiro can help
- **Trust Kiro**: When prompted for permissions, select **`t` (trust)** to let Kiro help you

## 🎉 You're Ready!

You now have everything you need to create applications using AI. Start with any of the examples above, then try creating your own ideas. Kiro will guide you through the entire process!

**Remember**: You don't need to know how to code. Just describe what you want, and Kiro will create it for you!
