# Design guidelines

* Always start with documenting the requirement in requirements.md
* Always create a design for you start to code
* Always validate your design by using the documentation tools
* Apply security best practices and do not compromise during the implementation (e.g. by bypassing guardrails, turning off encryption or using hardcoded credentials)
* Share the design with the human and ask for feedback
* Create separate folders for front-end and  back-end of a project

## Code revision guidelines

* Always commit your changes to git at the end of a code update
* Use a development branch per session, NEVER work directly in the main branch
* Never merge the development branch in main. The human will do that!
