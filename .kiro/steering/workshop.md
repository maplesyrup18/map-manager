# Workshop Environment Rules 

## Application Deployment
* **Deploy all applications in the `public` folder** - The workshop environment serves files from `/home/ec2-user/dev-server/public/` at the workshop's preview URL

## Development Server
* **Preview environment is pre-configured** - Applications are automatically accessible at the workshop's preview URL without additional setup
* **No port management needed** - The workshop environment handles all server configuration automatically
