# Rules for development

* Always use Python when creating AWS Lambda functions
* Always follow the design that you've created and shared with the human
* If you discover the approach doesn't work, do not start implementing alternatives, but go back to revising the design first
* Do not update existing code that is not directly related to the feature you are implementing or fixing
